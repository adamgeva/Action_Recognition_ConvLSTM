# Human Action Recognition Project

This project is based on the paper:

**LEI WANG, YANGYANG XU, JUN CHENG, HAIYING XIA, JIANQIN YIN, AND JIAJI WU. Human Action Recognition by Learning Spatio-Temporal Features With Deep Neural Networks**

The code is structured using this great Tensoflow template:
